# Data-Driven-Approach-to-Alleviate-EV-Range-Anxiety-Real-Time-Optimization-and-Monitoring

Range anxiety—the fear of depleting battery power while driving—is a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). This project introduces EV-CARE, a scalable software and data engineering platform designed to mitigate range anxiety by leveraging real-time data ingestion, predictive analytics, and machine learning. EV-CARE integrates EV telemetry, traffic data, and environmental conditions to optimize energy consumption, recommend energy-efficient routes, and manage charging infrastructure. 

Key features of the platform include: 

Real-time energy monitoring to track vehicle performance. 

Predictive route recommendations based on energy consumption forecasts. 

Charging station availability management for efficient trip planning. 

Built using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda, EV-CARE is designed to ensure scalability and reliability. By equipping drivers and fleet operators with advanced tools for efficient EV management, the platform aims to enhance the reliability of EV usage and accelerate the transition to electric mobility.
