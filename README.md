Range anxiety, the fear of running out of battery power, is a key barrier to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). While EVs offer a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional vehicles, range anxiety undermines consumer confidence and limits market growth. 


The EV-CARE platform aims to address this challenge by leveraging real-time data ingestion, predictive analytics, and machine learning to optimize energy consumption, provide energy-efficient route recommendations, and manage charging station availability. Using advanced data engineering tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda, EV-CARE delivers a scalable and reliable solution to mitigate range anxiety and enhance EV user experience. 


By empowering drivers and fleet operators with actionable insights, EV-CARE seeks to promote EV adoption, reduce environmental impact, and foster a sustainable future in transportation. 

Key features of the platform include: 

Real-time energy monitoring to track vehicle performance. 

Predictive route recommendations based on energy consumption forecasts. 

Charging station availability management for efficient trip planning. 

Built using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda, EV-CARE is designed to ensure scalability and reliability. By equipping drivers and fleet operators with advanced tools for efficient EV management, the platform aims to enhance the reliability of EV usage and accelerate the transition to electric mobility.
